	 			<h1>About Me</h1>
	 			<p>My name is Natalie DellaMaria and I am a Junior Computer Science major at Clemson University. I am interested in full stack software development and data science.<br \><br \>

	 			I had a techinical internship position as a software developer at Insitu, an information company that makes drones for commercial and defense purposes.<br \><br \>

	 			Outside of academics, I am involved as Head of Logistics for CUhackers. This organization plans and runs CUhackit, Clemson's annual hackathon and creates a community of hackers that travel and participate in hackathons across the country. I also spend my time working for Clemson's Outdoor Recreation department leading weekend outdoor adventure trips such as backpacking and whitewater rafting. 
	 			When I have free time, I enjoy running, reading, and playing card games with my friends.<br \><br \>

	 			I grew up in a suburb of Chicago called Crystal Lake where I spent most of my time playing competative soccer, climbing trees, and reading the Harry Potter series too many times.</p>
