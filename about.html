	 			<h1>About Me</h1>
	 			<p>My name is Natalie DellaMaria, and I am a Junior Computer Science major at Clemson University. I am interested in full stack software development and data science.<br \><br \>

	 			In the summer of 2018, I was a software development intern at Insitu, an industry-leading information company that creates unmanned drone systems and other technologies that collect, process and analyze data. I specifically worked in C and C++ to update the frontend and backend of flight simulation applications, merge streams of code through Perforce, and redesign and optimize implementations.<br \><br \>

	 			Outside of academics, I am the Head of Technology and Logistics for CUhackers. This organization plans and runs CUhackit, Clemson's annual hackathon, and creates a community of hackers that travels and participates in hackathons across the country. I also work for Clemson's Outdoor Recreation department where I lead weekend outdoor adventure trips such as backpacking and whitewater rafting. 
	 			When I have free time, I enjoy running, reading, and playing card games with my friends.<br \><br \>

	 			Although I was born in France, I grew up in a suburb of Chicago called Crystal Lake where I spent much of my time playing competitive soccer, climbing trees, and reading the Harry Potter series too many times.</p>
